# Punctuation Sprint Overview

## Executive Summary

This sprint addresses the critical over-punctuation issue in the voice transcription application where users experience fragmented sentences due to hardcoded Deepgram API settings and lack of intelligent post-processing.

**Problem**: Voice transcription adds too many sentence-ending punctuation marks when users take minor pauses, resulting in output like "Hello. World. Today. Is. Great." instead of "Hello world, today is great."

**Solution**: Multi-layered approach combining API configuration improvements, intelligent post-processing, user controls, and enhanced OpenAI integration.

## Sprint Goals

1. **Reduce Over-Punctuation** by 80%+ through improved API configuration
2. **Implement Smart Merging** to intelligently combine sentence fragments
3. **Provide User Control** over punctuation sensitivity levels
4. **Enhance Quality** of OpenAI prompt processing with fragmented input
5. **Maintain Performance** with <10ms processing overhead

## Technical Strategy

### Priority 1: API Configuration (Ticket #01)

**Root Cause Fix**: Replace hardcoded `punctuate=True` and 10ms endpointing with configurable parameters

- Increase endpointing to 300-500ms default
- Add Voice Activity Detection (VAD) events
- Implement configurable punctuation sensitivity levels

### Priority 2: Post-Processing Pipeline (Ticket #02)

**Intelligent Recovery**: Smart fragment detection and merging for remaining over-punctuation

- Real-time fragment scoring algorithm
- Time-based merging with 800ms threshold
- Grammatical structure analysis

### Priority 3: User Controls (Ticket #03)

**User Empowerment**: GTK UI controls for punctuation preferences

- Sensitivity slider (Off/Minimal/Balanced/Aggressive)
- Advanced settings for endpointing and merge threshold
- Real-time configuration updates

### Priority 4: Enhancement Optimization (Ticket #04)

**Quality Improvement**: Fragment-aware OpenAI prompt enhancement

- Pre-processing to reconstruct fragments before enhancement
- Updated system prompts that handle fragmented input
- Improved token estimation for fragment overhead

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow with New Components

```
User Speech → Audio Capture → Deepgram API (Enhanced Config) →
PunctuationProcessor (Smart Merge) → UI Update →
Optional: OpenAI Enhancement (Fragment-Aware)
                    ↑
            User Controls (GTK)
```

### Configuration Schema Evolution

```json
{
  // Existing config preserved
  "prompt_mode_enabled": false,
  "enhancement_style": "detailed",

  // New punctuation settings
  "punctuation_settings": {
    "sensitivity_level": 2, // 0=off, 1=minimal, 2=balanced, 3=aggressive
    "endpointing_ms": 400, // Pause detection threshold
    "smart_merge_enabled": true, // Enable post-processing
    "merge_threshold_ms": 800, // Fragment merge window
    "min_sentence_length": 3 // Minimum words before merging
  },

  // Version for migration
  "config_version": "3.4.0"
}
```
